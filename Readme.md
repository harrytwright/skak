## Overview

This will be a simple chess engine, guided by both [TSCP](http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/TSCP/#:~:text=Tom%20Kerrigan's%20Simple%20Chess%20Program,2%2C258%20lines%20of%20C%20code)
and [bluefever software's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg) video series. 
This is just a side project to understand how engines work at a very rudimentary level and work on my C and in the 
future C++ skills.

## Files

This distribution of the engine consists of the following files:

- Readme.md, the file you are currently reading.
- .enginerc, a metadata file for versioning and configuration
- CMakeLists.txt, for building
- files with `.{c,h}` extensions, the sourcecode, will be moved to a `./src` folder in the future

## Usage
